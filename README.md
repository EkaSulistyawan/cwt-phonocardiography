# cwt-phonocardiography
This repo present an analysis pipeline for phonocardiograph (PCG). The pipeline includes Signal Filtering and Continuous Wavelet Transform (using Morlet) to understand heart defect according to chest acoustic signal. <br>
**Purpose**: PCG Exploratory Analysis for Heart Defect <br>
The dataset used were:
1. Arterial Septal Defect (asd)
2. Murmur (mm)
3. Mitral Regurgigation (mr)
4. Ventricular Septal Defect (vsd)
5. Normal (normal)
> :warning: Please contact me (sulis347[at]gmail[dot]com) for the dataset!
